# Project Motivation
I am always fascinated by the e-commerce platforms as these provides a new shopping experience which is different than the centuries old traditional shopping experience. It's first time for me to look into an e-commerce platform with a lens ofa data scientist. Some of the questions, I tried to answer in this notebook are:

- What is the overall condition of the products? 
- What is the shipment process and how it impacts the product price?
- How important is the brand name, which brands are popular and which ones are most expensive?
- What kind of products are popular and what kind of products are more expensive?
- Is there any free product?
